            <p>Audie Murphy was one of the most decorated United States
                Army combat soldiers of World War II, serving from 1942 to 1945. He received every American
                combat award for valor available at the time of his service, including the Medal of Honor.</p>

            <p>Murphy was born on 20th June, 1925, in Kingston, a small rural community in Hunt County in northeastern
                Texas. He was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy (1887–1976) and his wife Josie
                Bell Murphy. As a child, Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper.</p>
            <p>His father drifted in and out of the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of
                school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he
                also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them.</p>
            <p>After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at
                a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his
                three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war,
                he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband, Poland Burns. His other
                siblings briefly shared the home.</p>

            <p>Murphy wanted to join the Marines but had to settle for the infantry because he was too short. He
                later became one of the most celebrated heroes of World War II.</p>

            <h3>World War II Service</h3>
            <p>Murphy had always wanted to be a soldier. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he
                tried to enlist, but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and
                underage. After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year, he was
                accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942. After basic training at Camp Wolters, he was sent to Fort
                Meade for advanced infantry training</p>
            <p>Murphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943. He was assigned to Company B, 1st
                Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, which trained under the command of Major
                General Lucian Truscott. After the 13 May surrender of the Axis forces in French Tunisia, the division
                was put in charge of the prisoners. He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in
                Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily. Murphy was promoted to private
                first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July</p>
            <p>When the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a division runner. On a
                scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì. Sidelined with illness for a
                week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July, he rejoined them when they were assigned to a
                hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division
                fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina</p>

            <p>Murphy became a national celebrity following his World War II military service when a magazine
                proclaimed him America's "most decorated soldier" in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. The
                magazine cover brought him to the attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to
                Hollywood. </p>

            <h3>Film Career</h3>
            <p>During an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969, Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one
                television series. When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of Life
                magazine depicting Murphy as the "most decorated soldier", he brought him to Hollywood. Cagney and
                his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training
                in acting, voice and dance.</p>
            <p>Murphy moved into Terry Hunt's Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948. Hollywood
                writer David "Spec" McClure befriended Murphy, collaborating with him on Murphy's 1949 book <em>To Hell
                    and
                    Back</em>. McClure used his connections to get a $500 bit part in <em>Texas, Brooklyn
                    & Heaven </em>(1948) for Murphy.</p>
